        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Jeff Lincoln Gitari, a dedicated and passionate software engineer with a strong background in developing innovative solutions using a variety of programming languages and technologies. My journey in the world of software engineering began with a curiosity to understand how technology can shape and improve our lives.
    
            I hold a deep fascination for problem-solving and have honed my skills in various programming languages, including Java, Python, JavaScript, C#, and C++. This versatile skill set allows me to work effectively across the full stack, from front-end development with HTML5, CSS3, and React.js to back-end development using Node.js, Express.js, and Python Django.
    
            During my academic journey, I have gained a strong foundation in computer science, including data structures and algorithms, object-oriented programming, database systems, and operating systems. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at UMMA UNIVERSITY, with an expected graduation in 2024.
    
            In my professional journey, I've had the privilege to work on diverse and challenging projects, including the development of an e-commerce web application using React.js and Firebase. This project allowed me to showcase my expertise in front-end development, user authentication, and database management. I take pride in creating seamless and user-friendly experiences that cater to the needs of the end-users.
    
            As a software engineer, I'm always eager to learn new technologies and stay updated with the latest industry trends. My strong analytical and problem-solving skills, combined with excellent communication and teamwork abilities, make me an asset in any collaborative and dynamic team.
    
            I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to contributing to innovative projects that drive positive change through technology. Feel free to reach out to me through my LinkedIn profile or email to discuss potential collaborations or just have a tech-related conversation.
